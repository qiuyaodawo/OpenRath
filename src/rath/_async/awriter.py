"""Async session writer with a FIFO drain task.

Runtime-internal counterpart of :class:`~rath.session.persistence.SessionWriter`.
The session-loop coroutine never touches the filesystem directly — it
``await``s :meth:`_AsyncSessionWriter.awrite_chunk`, which enqueues the
``(index, row)`` onto a bounded :class:`asyncio.Queue` and returns
immediately after the queue accepts the item. A single background drain
task pops items in order and writes them via :func:`asyncio.to_thread` so
slow flushes never park the runtime loop.

Properties relied on by the runtime:

- FIFO ordering — a single drain task with a single open file handle.
- Strict header-first — the underlying :class:`SessionWriter` writes its
  header in ``__init__`` (WAL), so a crash before the first chunk still
  leaves a visible ``__partial__`` file with a parseable header.
- Backpressure — the queue is bounded (``maxsize=256``); a producer that
  outruns the disk awaits queue capacity instead of growing memory
  without bound.
- ``aclose()`` — drains the queue, writes the trailer, atomically
  renames the ``__partial__`` file to its final ``.jsonl`` name.
- ``abandon()`` — cancels the drain task, releases the handle, and
  leaves the ``__partial__`` file in place (crash / drain-timeout signal).
