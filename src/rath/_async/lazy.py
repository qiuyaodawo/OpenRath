"""Lazy materialization handle for :class:`~rath.session.Session`.

When the public :func:`~rath.session.loop.run_session_loop` returns, the
work is still running on :class:`~rath._async.runtime.OpenRathRuntime`.
The returned :class:`Session` carries a :class:`LazyValue` in
``_pending``; reading :attr:`Session.chunk_table` /
:attr:`Session.cumulative_usage` calls :meth:`Session.synchronize` which
blocks on this :class:`LazyValue` and writes the result into the
session's materialized fields.

PyTorch CUDA Stream analogue: ``runtime().submit(coro)`` schedules work
on the loop and returns a sync :class:`concurrent.futures.Future`;
``LazyValue.result()`` is the implicit ``synchronize()`` call.

Concurrency-safety invariants:

- The future's ``add_done_callback`` runs on the runtime loop thread.
  ``unraisable_warn`` is a callback installed by :class:`Session` to
  surface dropped failures (no one ever called ``synchronize``) as
  ``warnings.warn`` + ``logger.exception``, not as silent loss.
- ``LazyValue.consumed`` is flipped by :class:`Session.synchronize` (in
  the host thread under ``_sync_lock``) so the unraisable callback can
  tell "result was observed" from "result was dropped". The flip is
  monotonic and idempotent.
