"""Process-wide background asyncio loop with sync ``submit`` / ``run``.

``OpenRathRuntime`` hosts one daemon thread running an asyncio event loop.
All async work in OpenRath (backend dispatch, LLM completions, session loops,
persistence writers) is funnelled through this loop so that:

- Multiple coroutines share one loop and run truly concurrently (no per-call
  thread-pool spin-up, no ad-hoc ``asyncio.run`` per call).
- Synchronous user code keeps calling synchronous OpenRath APIs; the runtime
  is the only place that has to know coroutines exist.

Concurrency-safety rules this module enforces:

- ``submit(coro)`` returns a ``concurrent.futures.Future`` and never blocks.
- ``run(coro)`` blocks the calling thread. If the caller is *itself* inside
  a running asyncio loop, blocking would deadlock that loop; we raise
  instead. The session loop / backend dispatch path never calls ``run``
  recursively — only sync facades on the host thread do — so this is the
  correct behavior.
- ``drain(timeout)`` waits for in-flight futures and cancels stragglers on
  timeout (cancellation semantics for atexit / explicit shutdown).
- ``shutdown()`` stops the loop and joins the thread.
