"""OpenSandboxBackend async-internal behaviour — real opensandbox-server, no mocks.

Validates the post-migration ``OpenSandboxBackend``:

- Concurrent ``commands.run`` on the same sandbox serialise behind the
  per-sandbox exec lock.
- Concurrent ``files.write`` to the *same* path serialise behind the
  per-path fs lock (last-writer-wins is deterministic; no torn payloads).
- Concurrent ``files.write`` to *distinct* paths run in parallel.
- Concurrent reads do not serialise behind any lock.

These tests require a reachable opensandbox-server (see ``conftest.py``'s
``opensandbox_real`` marker). There is no ``FakeSandbox`` fallback — the suite
is skipped, not faked, when the server is unreachable.
