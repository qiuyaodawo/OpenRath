"""Async session writer tests — real filesystem, no mocks.

Drives :class:`rath._async.awriter._AsyncSessionWriter` from coroutines
running on the OpenRath runtime loop (the ``asyncio.Queue`` and drain task
must be created on the runtime loop).

Coverage:

- Header is written **synchronously** on construction (WAL invariant —
  the ``__partial__`` file exists before any ``await`` surfaces).
- Concurrent ``awrite_chunk`` calls drain to disk in **enqueue** order
  (FIFO via single drain task / single file handle).
- ``aclose()`` writes the trailer and atomically promotes
  ``__partial__`` → final ``.jsonl``.
- ``abandon()`` cancels the drain task and **leaves** ``__partial__``
  in place (partial file left as crash signal).
- ``awrite_chunk`` after ``aclose`` raises ``RuntimeError`` (closed-state
  guard, so callers fail fast instead of silently dropping rows).
- A failing write **latches** the error onto subsequent calls so the
  caller short-circuits rather than blindly piling rows onto a broken
  handle.
- Bounded ``asyncio.Queue`` exerts backpressure (a slow drain blocks the
  producer instead of growing memory without bound).
